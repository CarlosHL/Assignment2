The program receives as a parameter the map and the value of epsilon

Changing the value of epsilon, the error of the model changer, therefore  the algorithm may stop in a different iteration. 
This may cause eventually a change in the utilities of the nodes and a different path solution, but for the map given, the solution 
remain the same (not the utilities).
